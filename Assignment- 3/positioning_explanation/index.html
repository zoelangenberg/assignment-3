  <section class="fixed">
    <p>My container is <span>position: fixed</span> and I have pushed myself against the right-hand side.</p>
    <p>Scroll down the page but I will stay glued to the screen.</p>
    <p>I am commonly used in navigation menus that are forced to stay on the screen.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="static">
    <p>My container is <span>position: static</span></p>
    <p>If you don't provide a position property for an element, it is by default static, like my container</p>
  </section>
  <section class="relative">
    <p>My container is <span>position: relative</span></p>
    <p>I am positioned relative to my normal position.</p>
    <p>I am currently 2% left of where I would normally sit.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="absolute">
    <p>My container is <span>position: absolute</span></p>
    <p>I am positioned in the center of the page (check my css).</p>
    <p>Since I have no parent element with position: relative, I am positioned relative to the entire page.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="relative-parent">
    <p>My container is <span>position: relative</span></p>
    <p>I contain an element that has position: absolute</p>
    <section class="absolute-child">
      <p>My container is <span>position: absolute</span></p>
      <p>I am inside a position: relative container, so I am positioned relative to my parent container.</p>
      <p>I am pushed against my parent element's bottom, right-hand side</p>
    </section>
